# Note: /public must be a path relative to the root of the git repository. In
#       this example, the /public directory contains files that the Heroku app
#       will serve to the public, and may be named anything. It corresponds
#       roughly to the default /htdocs directory served by Apache.

# To use Apache at Heroku:
web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 /public

# To use nginx at Heroku:
# web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx /public
